# Resume Editor - Frontend (React + Vite)

This is the frontend for the web-based **Resume Editor** built using **React.js** with **Vite**. It allows users to upload, edit, enhance, and download their resumes. This application interacts with a FastAPI backend to enhance resume sections using mock AI and save user data.

---

## Features

-  **Upload Resume**: Accepts `.pdf` and `.docx` files. Uses mocked content after upload.
- **Edit Resume**: Users can edit fields like name, experience, education, and skills. New entries can be added or removed.
- **Enhance with AI**: Each section includes a button to enhance content. Sends data to the backend via `/ai-enhance`.
-  **Save Resume**: Sends complete JSON resume to backend via `/save-resume`.
-  **Download Resume**: Allows users to download the final resume as a `.json` file.
